# FastTalk

FastTalk is a Rails app for scheduling Lightning talks / Show and Tells. Each Session has a unique hashed url, which can be shared around the company. Speakers can then select a time slot and add details for their talk. 

## Usage

FastTalk is deployed [here](https://pacific-beyond-44283.herokuapp.com/) with Heroku. 

## Technology

FastTalk uses vanilla Javascript on the frontend, and Rails with Postgres on the backend.
