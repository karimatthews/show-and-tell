# FastTalk

FastTalk is a Rails app for scheduling Lightning talks / Show and Tells. Each Session has a unique url, which is shared around the company. Speakers can then select a time slot and add details for their talk. 

## Usage

FastTalk will soon be deployed through Heroku. 

## Technology

ParkPups uses vanilla Javascript on the frontend, and Rails with Postgres on the backend.
